A simple number guessing game built in C language, where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.  This project was created as part of my learning journey to strengthen my understanding of loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation in C.
## 🚀 Features
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100  
- Provides hints ("Too high" / "Too low")  
- Counts the number of attempts  
- Clean console-based interface

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Using loops and conditional statements in C  
- Generating random numbers with `rand()` and `srand()`  
- Handling user input using `scanf()`  
- Basic program logic and debugging
