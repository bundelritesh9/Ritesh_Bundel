## 📂 Featured Projects

### [Number Guessing Game in C](https://github.com/bundelritesh9/Ritesh_Bundel/blob/main/number_guessing_game.c)  
A number guessing game that demonstrates core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and random number generation.  
**Key learning points:** Handling user input, debugging logic, structuring a simple program.

### [Hangman Challenge in C](https://github.com/bundelritesh9/Ritesh_Bundel/blob/main/hangman_game.c)
Welcome to the **Hangman Challenge**! This is a simple console-based word-guessing game implemented in **C**. Players have a limited number of lives to guess the hidden word, one letter at a time.

 ## Concepts Used

 ### C Concepts
 - Loops: Repeating actions for guessing and updating the word.  
 - Conditionals: Checking if the guessed letter is correct or wrong.  
 - Logic/Algorithm: Updating letters, tracking lives, and checking win/loss.  
 - Input & Output: Interacting with the player to get guesses and display progress.  

 ### Math Concepts
 - Counting & Iteration: Tracking letters and remaining lives.  
 - Comparison: Matching guessed letters with the word.  
 - Boolean Logic: Using true/false flags to track correct guesses.  
 - Decrementing: Reducing lives after wrong guesses.

### [Snake–Water–Gun Game in C](https://github.com/bundelritesh9/Ritesh_Bundel/blob/main/Snake_Water_Gun_Game.c)

A simple console-based game built in C where the player competes against the computer in a classic **Snake–Water–Gun** game.  
This project demonstrates the use of **random number generation**, **conditional logic**, and **user input handling**.

## Features

- Player vs Computer gameplay  
- Randomized computer choices using `rand()` and `srand(time(NULL))`  
- Clear console output for gameplay  
- Simple and beginner-friendly C code  

## Tech Stack

- C Programming Language  
- Libraries: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `time.h`
